<p>This is a note web app that allows user to register and save their note. The plan for the notes is to encrypt the notes for security. This is my first MERN project and I have not yet fully understand how to utilize JWT to authenticate user the right way.</p>
<p>Side note: I tried to use redux but turned out it was too advanced for me and I decided to leave the usage of redux on Login feature.</p>

<p>Feel free to contribute, gladly take any suggestions or comments</p>
